Here's some pseudo code for the game

1st - the user sees the page with the instructions(The html has already been created but it needs styling)

The user sees a randomly generated number in the box.

Next to the box the user sees the win and loss totals

The user clicks on crystals with randomly assigned values

The values are added together and displayed to the user

If the user is able to match the random number then  they win

If the user goes over the random number then they lose

When the user wins or loses the game resets and everything has new values
